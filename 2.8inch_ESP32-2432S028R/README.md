## 📦 Vendor-Provided Files

The contents of this repository are based on a `.rar` archive originally provided by the board's vendor.   

These files are tailored specifically for **this board model and its integrated modules**.

> ⚠️ Due to the diversity of module and IC configurations across different boards, there is no universal software / module drivers compatible with all variations. 
> 
> The provided files are **not guaranteed to work on other hardware**.

## 📁 Original File Availability

The original vendor `.rar` file is **not publicly available online**, nor was a repository or official mirror found. This GitHub repository exists to preserve and share the specific files included in that vendor package.

## 🛡️ Security Notice (Read Carefully)

The original archive contained several **Windows-based utilities**, which have been **removed** from this repository.

- Some of those utilities were flagged by [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) as potentially malicious.

- This is likely due to their nature as **portable WinPE tools** that perform **low-level operations**, such as modifying RAM parameters.

> ⚠️ **Use with Caution:**  
> I **strongly advise against using these utilities** unless you fully understand what they do and accept the associated risks.

> ✅ **Safer Alternative:**  
> In all the cases, this board can be programmed using **standard, open-source, or widely trusted tools** that do not involve elevated risk.
